=== 6. Per-Neuron-Type W Recovery (Top 10 Hardest Types) ===
Which neuron types are hardest to recover for each model?


=== 7. Model 049 vs 003 Comparison (Opposite Hard Types) ===
Batch 1 found corr=-1.000 between 049 and 003 type difficulties.
This means OPPOSITE types are hard. Why?


=== 8. Model 049 Deeper Dive: Why Does lr_W=1E-3 Fail? ===
Model 011 improved dramatically with lr_W=1E-3, but 049 got worse.


=== 9. Summary: Model Difficulty Categories ===

MODEL DIFFICULTY ASSESSMENT:
--------------------------------------------------
Model 049: FAILING    (R²=0.130) - lr_W=1E-3 fails; need different approach
Model 011: PARTIAL    (R²=0.674) - lr_W=1E-3 helps conn but edge_diff=900 hurts
Model 041: CONVERGED  (R²=0.883) - Connectivity OK but V_rest collapsed
Model 003: SOLVED     (R²=0.968) - edge_diff=900 optimal, all metrics good

======================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT BATCH:
======================================================================

Model 049: Try BASELINE lr (6E-4) + edge_diff=900 + W_L1=3E-5
  - lr_W=1E-3 fails for this model specifically
  - edge_diff=900 works for Model 003, may help stabilize 049
  - Focus on regularization, not learning rate

Model 011: Return to edge_diff=750, try W_L1=2E-5
  - edge_diff=900 hurt connectivity, revert
  - Lower W_L1 may help V_rest without connectivity loss

Model 041: Try edge_diff=1200 + phi_L1=1.0
  - Stronger regularization needed for V_rest
  - Connectivity is stable, focus on secondary metrics

Model 003: Maintain edge_diff=900, try phi_L1=0.6
  - Model is solved, minor improvements only
  - Test if phi_L1 can improve V_rest further
